Welcome to housetable Network Veterinarian Hospital Data API!

  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a small system API, which manages hospital patient data and their appointments

The system should have the following features:
1.       Adding a new patient 
(patient details should contain a pet name, pet type (cat, dog, bird), owner name, and owner address, owner phone number).
2.       Getting a list of all patients in the hospital
3.       Update patient details
4.       Delete patient details
5.       Adding an appointment to an existing patient (appointment details should contain appointment start time, appointment end time, description, the fee paid by the USD or EUR or Bitcoin /unpaid and the amount).
6.       Get a list of all appointments for a specific patient.
7.       Update appointment details.
8.       Delete appointment details.
9.         Get a list of appointments for a specific day.
10.       Get a list of unpaid appointments.
11.       Get a remaining bill for a specific patient.
12.       Get the weekly and monthly amount paid, unpaid and balance of hospital in dollars.
13.     Get the most popular pet, and how much money from each pet.



Clarifications:
·	Must use Typescript.
·	Must create error events.
·	Focus is on advance queries.
·	Use the jest framework for testing, create the following tests: (mock the database, unit testing and integration testing).
·	Feel free to add more information for both data objects
·	Multiple appointments can happen simultaneously, there is no need to check for appointment time conflicts
·	Use the following currencies (USD, EUR, Bitcoin)
·	work with MongoDB or MySQL for storing user data
·	The final project should run using a single command (NPM start) for all the code parts
·	Once you finish with the mission, please commit all your work to a GIT repo and send us the link


Good luck
